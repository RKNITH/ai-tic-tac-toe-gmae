## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
````

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:

```env
PORT=5000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` folder:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the frontend in your browser (`http://localhost:5173` by default).
2. Choose your cell to place `X`.
3. The AI (`O`) will immediately respond with its move.
4. Play until there’s a **winner** or a **draw**.
5. Click **Restart Game** to play again.

---

## 🧠 AI Logic

The backend sends the board state to Gemini with a carefully crafted prompt:

* AI **blocks player’s winning moves**.
* AI **prefers winning moves** if available.
* AI chooses logically, not randomly.
* AI plays like a **human competitor** without requiring pre-trained datasets.



## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Multiplayer mode (player vs player online)
* Difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard AI)
* Move history and replay feature
* Mobile app version
